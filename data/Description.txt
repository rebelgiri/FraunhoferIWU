1.       Takes an std::string object as constructor argument pointing to the filesystem location of the binaray data file

2.       Internally computes the discrete Fourier transformation of the samples

3.       Has a public member method returning an std container containing the resulting complex frequency bins of the Fourier transform

This is a string object passing  as constructor argument pointing to the file system location ??
[01:57, 9/25/2020] Yousuf Imam New: is this declaration correct ??
[01:57, 9/25/2020] Yousuf Imam New: and if Yes then-  wordFileName - me file ka location ya name kaha or kaise denge ... I mean the path
